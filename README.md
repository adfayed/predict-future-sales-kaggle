# Predict Future Sales Kaggle
This is a Machine Learning Kaggle Competition Project aimed at prediciting future sales for using a challenging time-series dataset which consists of daily sales data by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company. 

We predict total sales for every product and store in the following month.
