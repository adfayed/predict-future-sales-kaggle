# Project Title
This is a Machine Learning Kaggle Competition Project aimed at prediciting future sales for using a challenging time-series dataset which consists of daily sales data by one of the largest Russian software firms - 1C Company. 

We predict total sales for every product and store in the following month.

Give examples
```
Note: sales_train.csv could not be uploaded to this repository since it is >50Mb. Please follow the competition link in the Project Title to acquire this file.

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
